# Moveo Homework Assignment 

### This project was done as a part of my application process to moveo.
### This project aims to levrege terraform and docker to create an inferstrcture that sets up a secure custom ngnix container on an ec2 instance 

## the ec2 instance is "protacted by an application load balancer" 
## Keep in mind That I used an ALB that works with HTTPS meaning I payed to register a Domain this wasnt done in the terraform code because of the difficultys terraform has with this spesifyc task
